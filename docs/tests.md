Test coverage
====

Test coverage is fundamental to the reliability and advancement of the Carbon Aware SDK. 
This guide highlights our structured approach to testing, underlining our commitment to deliver a dependable and progressively improving SDK for enterprise use and beyond. 
Here, we detail our test coverage targets for the Core SDK and samples, pivotal in achieving our high-quality standards.

# Core SDK

The Core SDK is built to work for entreprise and we aspire to work with no regression, high levels of reliability and stability.
As for the core SDK, we have a 70% test coverage target and expect this increase overtime.

# Sample 

Samples come with a lower SLA and maybe incompatible/compatible with certain versions.
As such, for the samples, the target for test coverage is on a case by case basis.
